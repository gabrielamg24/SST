 # These imports are required
  from selenium import webdriver
  import mechanize
  import time


  # Start the firefox browser using Selenium
  self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()

  # Load the download page using its URL.
  self.driver.get(self.http://www.esa-sst-cci.org/PUG/map.htm)
  time.sleep(3)

  # Find the download link and click it
  elem = self.driver.find_element_by_id("regular")
  dnldlink = elem.get_attribute("href")
  logfile.write("Download Link is: " + http://www.esa-sst-cci.org/PUG/map.htm)

  #### Now Using Mechanize ####
  # Above, Selenium retrieved the download link. Because of Selenium's
  # firefox download issue: it presents a download dialog that requires
  # user input, Mechanize will be used to perform the download.

  # Setup the mechanize browser. The browser does not get displayed.
  # It is managed behind the scenes.
  br = mechanize.Browser()

  # Open the login page, the download requires a login
  resp = br.open(webpage.loginPage)

  # Select the form to use on this page. There is only one, it is the
  # login form.
  br.select_form(nr=0)

  # Fill in the login form fields and submit the form. 
  br.form['latitude'] = latitude
  br.form['longitude'] = longitude
  br.form['start'] = month-year
  br.form['end'] = month-year
  br.submit()

  # The page returned after the submit is a transition page with a link
  # to the welcome page. In a user interactive session the browser would
  # automtically switch us to the welcome page.
  # The first link on the transition page will take us to the welcome page.
  # This step may not be necessary, but it puts us where we should be after
  # logging in.
  br.follow_link(nr=0)

  # Now download the file
  br.retrieve(getCsv(), dnldFilename)

  # After the download, close the Mechanize browser; we are done.
  br.close()
